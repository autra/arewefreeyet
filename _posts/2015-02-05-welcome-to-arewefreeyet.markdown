This is an attempt to reference if we can really run free software in our devices. 

By mentioning if we can have devices with free software, or replace 
proprietary softwares in our current devices, this site aims at :

* Promote the use of free software by informing users about what is possible.
* Serve as a reference to developers and contributors to know where work is needed!

At least, that’s how I see it now, but it can change, particularly if you contribute! 
By the way, this site is on GPLv2 licence and the code is hosted on [github][sourceUrl].

So contributions welcome! Anyway I won’t be able to handle that alone guys :-)
