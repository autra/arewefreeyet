This is an attempt to reference if we can really run free software in our devices. 

By telling if we can have free software with a particular type of devices, this site aims at :

* Promote the use of free software by informing users about what is possible.
* Serve as a reference to developers and contributors to know where work is needed!

At least, that’s how I see it now, but it can change, particularly if you contribute! 
By the way, this site is on GPLv2 licence and the code is hosted on [github][sourceUrl].

So contributions welcome! Anyway I won’t be able to handle that alone guys :-)

Especially, I need :

* Your knowledge on existing open-source and free software stacks obviously!
* Another design. Seriously, this one sucks. 
* Everything else you can suggest, criticize or ask for!
